# Full Stack Web Developer

### **Udacity Final Project: Full Stack Capstone**

Stars Casting Agency, also known as the Capstone Project, is the final project of the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer program. This final project of the course was developed by Eduardo Raider - Software Engineer.

## Motivation

The project's objective is to engineer a robust database-backend web API with user access controls. This entails the development of secured endpoints designed access management protocols, complemented by a front-end interface optimized to efficiently consume and interact with this data while maintaining the access controls.

This initiative proposes to build a dashboard for a talent casting agency. This dashboard integrates both backend and frontend components, to meet distinct roles encompassing Executive Producers, Casting Directors, and Casting Assistants. The permissions for each role can be found in detail within the respective READMEs for both the frontend and backend through the provided links.

This project serves as a testament to the comprehensive skill set honed during the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer program. The proficiencies showcased span across SQL proficiency and adeptness in data modeling for web applications, anchored in the application of CRUS (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations bolstered by state-of-the-art Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) techniques. The project encapsulates a diverse gamut of competencies, encompassing API development, documentation, API testing, Identity Access Management, and the orchestration of role-based access controls (RBAC) across the technology stack.

Furthermore, the scope of this project extends to the domains of server deployment, underpinned by the encapsulation of applications within containers for portability and scalability, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to comprehension of the software development lifecycle.

In essence, this project constitutes a synthesis of acquired knowledge and expertise during the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program.

## Hosted Live App

The live application is hosted at: [https://udacity-capstone-frontend.vercel.app/](https://udacity-capstone-frontend.vercel.app/)

**_Access credentials for tests are located in the [frontend README.md](./frontend/README.md)_**

# About the Stack

This application's backbone comprises Python and Flask for the backend, and React with Vite for the frontend â€“ a perfect blend of technologies for robustness and efficiency. The database runs on PostgreSQL while Auth0 ensures secure access control. The dynamic hosting platform, Vercel [https://vercel.com/](https://vercel.com/), seamlessly hosts both the frontend and backend, resulting in a harmonious user experience.

## Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed application built using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, and Auth0 to provide a robust API for managing casting information, movies and actors. This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in backend development and security practices.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details and setup instructions.](./backend/README.md)

## Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to present users with an intuitive interface for seamless data consumption from the Flask server. This frontend project aims to showcase the skills acquired during the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer program.
